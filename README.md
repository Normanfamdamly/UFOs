## Overview:

The request was to find a way to display and organize the UFO data stored as a JavaScript array.  Dana wanted a way to provide a webpage that was more dynamic and would allow for people to be able to search for the sightings based on date, state, country and shape of the sighting.  

## Results:
### Time to search for your UFO sightings....

Upon landing on the page, you see all the data in one location.  You can scroll through it all, or choose to filter the data for specific topics, such as data, state, country or shape of the UFO.  The information can be searched over and over again, providing the client not only the filtered date, but the duration of the sighting and the comments about what took place.  



## Summary

As a whole the sight is great start, but the data needs to be cleaned or allow for lower case and upper-case spelling. It would also be a good idea to add in an automated website scrapper to keep the UFO sighting information from becoming outdated. Also, to make this more user friendly and functional it would be a good idea to add print/ export feature to the data for those clients doing research.
